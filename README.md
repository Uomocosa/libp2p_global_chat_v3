# Repo made for testing porpuses

1. It uses a sliglty modifed version of the
   ['eframe_template' repo](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template).
2. Looking at the [trunk](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk) examples I menage
   to add a functioning WebWorker.

# NOTE:

DO NOT USE THIS AS A TEMPLATE.<br> I have no wish in keeping this up to date,
and things will become depracated fast, mostly of the libraries used are still
in their 0.x version.
